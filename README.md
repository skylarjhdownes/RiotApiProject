Mucking about with the Riot Games API

Just a toy project at the moment, though I'm hoping to make it into something useful.  
Currently it pulls a summoner's match history and spits out a couple of statistics-
whether they use ranged or melee champions more often, and their win percentages with each.
Fork and hack away if you'd like.  :)
